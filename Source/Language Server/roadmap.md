# Road Map

## Editor integration

* Formating code (in-place)
* Convert from one assembler format to another (save as)
* Support Workspaces (research topic)

## Structured Comment Blocks

* Structured comment blocks to document and detect function entry points
* Follow Doxygen syntax (subset)? (although doxygen will probably not be able to parse it)
* Generate documentation from structured comment blocks (again doxygen?)
* Use structured comment blocks as code completion help

## Tool Chains

* Configurable syntax details (directive, casing etc)
* Support for project output thru 3rd party tools
* Decide on build system (Make, PowerShell, other?)

## Help / Guidance

* Display instruction docs as you type (extend hover also)
