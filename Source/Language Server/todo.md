# TODO list

* Intellisense for '+' ('-') and ',' does not work. Seems to get filtered out by vscode..?
* pre-load documents in a project. This gives us a code model (of the project) without having to open all documents. Multi-root related.
* extend symbol table with constants (defc)
* Display value of constants (defc) in hover (bytes) and process expressions for constants.
* extent logic on RET (C9) to include RETI and RETN (formatter-serializer, folding-ranges)
* replace default error output of grammar parser (console)
